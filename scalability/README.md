# Welcome to scalability page
> Hyperscale system attributes
> 1. Exponential growth in CPU & Storage
> 2. Linear growth rate in cost (build, operate, support, evolve)

## Rough Estimates 

* Bandwidth Calculation

* Storage Calculation

## Load Balancing
* To distribute the load received

## Caching
* Distributed Caching

* Where? on what side

* Reverse Proxy 
Mainly used for for interacting with third party, e.g. Lunr, Solr, ElasticSearch (external search framework), GetResponse, Twilio (external email system)

## Database
* Database Scaling

* Database choice

## Web Server

* Framework

## Code

* Documentation

* Linting

* Style check

* Hook

## Observability & Monitoring

* Pattern references for observability & monitoring

## Additional Concerns
