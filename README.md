First thing on my mind when I was asked to build/architect a Saved Search System is this personal so-called "principles"

1. Architecting is a journey/process and it should be beyond original specs & requirements
2. Sometimes its OK to make quick & bold changes if ~~something occurs~~ traffic trends toward the upper limit of the design capacity
3. Rely on data & metrics to make correct tech. design decisions
4. Ensure metrics are easy to observe and to understand
5. Workarounds are OK, but don't take it for too long because they are **Tech. Debts**


* Re-state the problem/question

* Mind-map

Scalability is a wide topic to cover, so I will explain more in [Scalability Page](scalability/README.md).
